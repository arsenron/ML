# Neural Network
&emsp;&emsp;In the repository we are beginning with classical Neural Network model 
with an emphasis on backpropagation steps, because these steps seem to be the most complicated.
We are going to derive formulas for computing backpropagation and implement matrix form of them in Python code.
